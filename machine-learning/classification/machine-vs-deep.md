# Machine Learning vs Deep Learning

![](machinevsdepp.jpg)

The superiority of DL approaches compared to other ML algorithms manifests itself when large (**huge**) quantities of **training data** are available.

The training of neural networks requires a specialized hardware:

- Before starting a project with DL, you need to ask if the company / lab has the necessary hardware
- Having one or more GPU available is a fundamental factor today (GPU are essential for parallelizing calculations)
- The deeper a network is, the more computational load is introduced

## Hardware purchase for DL

With **in-house solutions**, the company buys the necessary hardware and is the direct owner:

- Pros:
    - Extreme freedom of use of hardware
    - In the long run, it tends to have lower costs
- Cons:
    - Hardware maintenance is required (specialized technicians)
    - Hardware ages quickly
    - For large number of GPUs -> specific server rooms (with high energy consumption)
    - The GPU market is quite expensive and volatile
