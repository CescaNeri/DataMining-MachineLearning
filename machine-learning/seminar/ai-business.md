The team of *Ammagamma* is various, composed not only by engineers, but also philosophers and designers.

Their **vision** is to develop a society aware of the potentialities, implications and impacts of technology.

As a **mission**, they offer the best choice instruments through the development of artificial intelligence innovative solutions.

They master cutting-edge technology to make company processes easier, curating the whole life cycle.

**AI solutions implemented:**

1. Scheduling and optimized planning of production and organizational processes
2. API for the forecast of future trends and historic series
3. Data enrichment for the optimization of advanced analytics solutions
4. Warehouse forecasting and replenishment for the predictive management of the warehouse
5. Georouting API engine for the optimized planning of complex and bound scenarios
6. Intelligent document processing platform enabling classification and extraction of the information

## Shared Knowledge in the AI World

They develop educational projects in the intersection between the culture of data and humanistic thought, to lead people to the discovery of new growth frontiers.

Also, they devise new innovation paths that create a long-term value for the community and the territory.

*We use numbers to transform chaotic systems into organized, intuitive and verifiable models*

- **Descriptive Algorithms:** description of the variables that characterize a phenomenon to create its mathematical model (clustering, market basket analysis, BI systems)
- **Predictive Algorithms:** Information analysis to predict and control future behaviors of the phenomena (forecasting, regression, classification)
- **Prescriptive ALgorithms:** Development of prescriptive formulas to support and guide the process management (optimization, optimal control, next best action)

## AI Projects Development

1. Define the objectives and the context
2. Feasibility analysis and solution design
3. Proof od concept
4. Pilot
5. Deploy
6. Scale up
7. Post go-live and monitoring

**What can go wrong?**

DATA:

- Quality
- Null values
- Legal problems
- Security
- Dimension

COMPLEXITY AND BUSINESS CONSTRAINTS:

Constraints related to third parties in the business.

ADOPTION:

In the post deployment phase, the innovation department develop innovative solutions and then the department will not use it because they are skeptical. 

## Design Thinking

An approach to innovation that studies the adoption of a creative view to solve complex problems.
