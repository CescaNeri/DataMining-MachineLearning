## Assessment Method - EXAM

The exam consists in an oral exam on all the subjects (80%) of the course and an elaborate (20% - agreed with the teacher).

The **elaborate** must be carried out in the **Machine Learning** module, choosing between:
- Study an algorithm among those in the literature
- Analysis of a data set with mining techniques

There are no fixed dates for the exam, it can be defined with teachers along the whole academic year. 
The two modules must be discussed within *15 days*.
