# Bayesian Classifier

It is a probabilistic approach to solving classification problems.
In many applications, the relationship between attribute values and that of the class is not deterministic, due to noise data, hidden variables and difficulty in quantifying certain aspects.

- **Uncertainty about the outcome prediction**

Bayesian classifier model probabilistic relationships between attributes and the classification attribute.
