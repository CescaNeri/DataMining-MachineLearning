**K-Nearest Neighbor**

K-Nearest Neighbor is a simple algorithm that stores all the available cases and classifies the new data or case based on a similarity measure.

It is mostly used to classify a data point based on how its neighbors are classified.

## The R-Tree Index Structure

R-trees are extensions of B+-trees to multi-dimensional spaces:

- B+-trees organize objects into a set of non-overlapping one-dimensional intervals, applying this principle recursively form the leaves of the root.
- R-trees organize objects into a set of overlapping multi-dimensional intervals, applying this principle [TO ADD]
